YOU NEED TO USE THE INTERNET. IF YOU DO NOT USE THE INTERNET, THE SUBTITLED CINEMA AND DEAF SERVICE WEBSITE WILL NOT CLEARY OR WORK.

Also, the forms in Deaf Service page and Contact Us page will not work after submit. It had some issues which was it cannot connect the database. I decided to remove them. If it was connected the database, it would mess the website up.
